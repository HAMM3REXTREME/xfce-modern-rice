# xfce-modern-rice
Nice and simple Xfce rice.
Tested on Xfce 4.16 on Arch BTW.

# Installation:
Unzip it in the home directory, overwrite files as necessary. Preferably from tty.

# Things used for rice:
- Colloid GTK Theme
- Whisker Menu
- Elementary XFCE Icons
- lightdm-slick-greeter

### Tips:
- It might be useful to install extra packages like `xfce4-goodies`, `lightdm-slick-greeter`, `gvfs`, `catfish`.
- Use `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme prefer-dark` to make GTK4 apps prefer dark theme.
- Stuff to download (outside official repos):
    - lightdm-settings (AUR)
    - Colloid GTK Theme (https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-gtk-theme)
    - Elementary XFCE Icons (https://github.com/shimmerproject/elementary-xfce)
